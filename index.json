Which of the following operators are linear?  $ \\mathscr{ L } u = u_x + x u_y $. $ \\mathscr{ L } u = u_x + u u_y $.  (Page 5, Q3(c)(d)). For each of the following equations, state the order and whether it is nonlinear, linear inhomogeneous, or linear homogeneous; provide reasons.  $ u_t - u_{xxt} + u u_x = 0 $. $ u_{tt} - u_{xx} + x^2 = 0 $.  (Page 9, Q1). Solve the first-order equation $ 2u_t + 3u_x = 0 $ with the auxiliary condition $ u=\\sin x $ when $ t=0 $.  Homework 2 (Due in tutorial class in the week of Sept 19):\n (Page 27, Q3). Solve the boundary problem $ u\u0026rsquo;^\\prime = 0 $ for $ 0\u0026lt;x\u0026lt;1 $ with $ u\u0026rsquo;(0)+k u(0) = 0 $ and $ u\u0026rsquo;(1)\\pm k u(1)=0 $. Do the $+$ and $-$ cases separately. What is special about the case $k=2$? (Page 31, Q1). What is the type of each of the following equations?  $ u_{xx} - u_{xy} + 2 u _y + u_{yy} - 3 u_{yx} + 4u = 0$. $ 9 u_{xx} + 6 u_{xy} + u_{yy} + u_{x} = 0$.  (Page 32, Q6).

Let $M(T) = $ the maximum of $u(x,t)$ in the closed rectangle $\\{ 0 \\leq x \\leq l, 0 \\leq t \\leq T \\}$. Does $M(T)$ increase or decrease as a function of $T$? Let $m(T) = $ the minimum of $u(x,t)$ in the closed rectangle $\\{ 0 \\leq x \\leq l, 0 \\leq t \\leq T \\}$. Does $m(T)$ increase or decrease as a function of $T$?  (Page 46, Q4).

Use the energy method to show that $ \\int _0 ^1 u^2 dx$ is a strictly decreasing function of $t$.   Homework 7 (Due in tutorial class in the week of Oct. 31):\n (Page 111, Q2). Let $\\phi(x) \\equiv x^2$ for $0 \\leq x \\leq 1 = l$.  Calculate its Fourier sine series. Calculate its Fourier cosine series.  (Page 111, Q4). Find the Fourier cosine series of the function $ | \\sin x | $ in the interval $(-\\pi,\\pi)$. Use it to find the sums $$ \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{4 n^2 - 1} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^n}{4n^2 - 1}. $$ (Page 134, Q1). $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n x^{2n}$ is a geometric series.  Does it converge pointwise in the interval $-1\u0026lt;x\u0026lt;1$ ? Does it converge uniformly in the interval $-1\u0026lt;x\u0026lt;1$ ? Does it converge in the $L^2$ sense in the interval $-1\u0026lt;x\u0026lt;1$ ?\n(Hint: You can compute its partial sums explicitly.)  (Page 134, Q5).

Let $$ \\phi(x) = \\left\\{ \\begin{align} -1-x \\quad \u0026amp; \\text{for}\\quad -1 \u0026lt; x \u0026lt; 0 \\\\ +1-x \\quad \u0026amp; \\text{for}\\quad 0 \u0026lt; x \u0026lt; 1. \\end{align} \\right.$$  Find the full Fourier series of $\\phi(x)$ in the interval $(-1,1)$.

Homework 8 (Due in tutorial class in the week of Nov. 7):\n (Page 160, Q6). Solve $u_{xx} + u_{yy}=1$ in the annulus $a\u0026lt;r\u0026lt;b$ with $u(x,y)$ vanishing on both parts of the boundary $r=a$ and $r=b$. (Page 160, Q9). A spherical shell with inner radius $1$ and outer radius $2$ has a steady-state temperature distribution. Its inner boundary is held at $100\\unicode{x2103}$. Its outer boundary satisfies $\\partial u / \\partial r = - \\gamma \u0026lt; 0 $, where $\\gamma$ is a constant.  Find the temperature. (Hint: The temperature depends only on the radius.) What are the hottest and coldest temperatures? Can you choose $\\gamma$ so that the temperature on its outer boundary is $20\\unicode{x2103}$?  (Page 164~Page 165, Q1). Solve $u_{xx} + u_{yy}=0$ in the rectangle $0\u0026lt;x\u0026lt;a$, $0\u0026lt;y\u0026lt;b$ with the following boundary conditions: $$ \\begin{align} \u0026amp; u_x = -a \\quad \\text{on } x=0 \\qquad \u0026amp; u_x = 0 \\quad \\text{on } x=a \\\\ \u0026amp; u_y = b \\quad \\text{on } y=0 \\qquad \u0026amp; u_y = 0 \\quad \\text{on } y=b. \\end{align} $$ (Hint: Note that the necessary condition of Exercise 6.1.11 is satisfied. A shortcut is to guess that the solution might be a quadratic polynomial in $x$ and $y$.) (Page 165, Q4). Find the harmonic function in the square $\\{ 0\u0026lt;x\u0026lt;1, 0\u0026lt;y\u0026lt;1 \\}$ with the boundary conditions $u(x,0)=x$, $u(x,1)=0$, $u_x(0,y)=0$, $u_x( 1,y )=y^2$.

Solve $u_{xx} + u_{yy}=0$ in the disk $D=\\{r\u0026lt;a\\}$ with the boundary condition $$ u = 1 + 3 \\sin \\theta \\quad \\text{on } r=a. $$ (Page 175, Q1). Solve $u_{xx} + u_{yy}=0$ in the exterior $\\{r\u0026gt;a\\}$ of a disk, with the boundary condition $u=1+3\\sin\\theta$ on $r=a$, and the condition at infinity that $u$ be bounded as $r\\longrightarrow\\infty$. (Page 176, Q10).Solve $u_{xx} + u_{yy}=0$ in the quarter-disk $\\{ x^2 + y^2 \u0026lt; a^2, x\u0026gt;0, y\u0026gt;0 \\}$ with the following BCs: $$ u=0 \\quad \\text{on } x=0 \\text{ and on } y=0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r} = 1 \\quad \\text{on } r=a.$$ Write the answer as an infinite series and write the first two nonzero terms explicitly.  Homework 10 (Due in tutorial class in the week of Nov. 21):\n (Page 184, Q2). Prove the uniqueness up to constants of the Neumann problem using the energy method. (Page 184, Q3). Prove the uniqueness of the Robin problem $ \\partial u / \\partial n + a(\\mathbf{x}) u(\\mathbf{x}) = h(\\mathbf{x})$ provided that $a(\\mathbf{x})\u0026gt;0$ on the boundary. (Page 187, Q1). Derive the representation formula for harmonic functions in two dimensions: $$ u(\\mathbf{x}_0) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{\\text{bdy} D} \\left[ u(\\mathbf{x}) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n} ( \\log |\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}_0| ) - \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial n} \\log |\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}_0| \\right] ds.$$ (Page 187, Q2). Let $\\phi(\\mathbf{x})$ be any $\\mathbf{C}^2$ function defined on all of three-dimensional space that vanishes outside some sphere. Show that $$ \\phi(\\mathbf{0}) = - \\iiint \\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{x}|} \\Delta \\phi(\\mathbf{x}) \\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{4\\pi}. $$ The integration is taken over the region where $\\phi(\\mathbf{x})$ is not zero.  Homework 11 (Due in tutorial class in the week of Nov. 28):\n (Page 196, Q1). Find the one-dimensional Green\u0026rsquo;s function for the interval $(0,l)$. The three properties defining it can be restated as follows.  It solves $G\u0026rsquo;^\\prime (x) = 0$ for $x\\neq x_0$ (\u0026ldquo;harmonic\u0026rdquo;). $G(0) = G(l) = 0$. $G(x)$ is continuous at $x_0$ and $G(x) + \\frac{1}{2} | x - x_0 |$ is harmonic at $x_0$.  (Page 196, Q6).  Find the Green\u0026rsquo;s function for the half-plane $ \\{ (x,y): y\u0026gt;0 \\} $. Use it to solve the Dirichlet problem in the half-plane with boundary values $h(x)$.

(Hint: Either do it from scratch by reflecting across the tilted plane, or change variables in the double integral (3) $$ 0 = \\iint_{\\text{bdy }D} \\left( u \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial n} - \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial n} H \\right) dS $$ using a linear transformation.) (Page 197, Q17).  Find the Green\u0026rsquo;s function for the quadrant $$ Q = \\{ (x,y) : x\u0026gt;0,y\u0026gt;0 \\}.$$ (Hint: Either use the method of reflection or reduce to the half-plane problem by the transformation $(x,y) \\mapsto (x^2-y^2,2xy)$.) 2, Use your answer in the previous part to solve the Dirichlet problem $$ \\begin{eqnarray} u_{xx} + u_{yy} = 0 \\text{ in } Q, \\quad u(0,y) = g(y) \\text{ for } y\u0026gt;0, \\\\ u(x,0) = h(x) \\text{ for } x\u0026gt;0. \\end{eqnarray} $$    Answers and Hints  Homework 1: Answers and Hints.

The algorithm is based on minimizing piecewise constant Mumford-Shah functional in which the contour length (or perimeter) is approximated by a non-local multi-phase energy. The minimization problem is solved by an iterative method. Each iteration consists of computing simple convolutions followed by a thresholding step. The algorithm is easy to implement and has the optimal complexity O(N logN) per iteration. We also show that the iterative algorithm has the total energy decaying property. We present some numerical results to show the efficiency of our method.","tags":["MBO","Image Segmentation","FFT"],"title":"An Efficient Iterative Thresholding Method for Image Segmentation","type":"publication"}]
