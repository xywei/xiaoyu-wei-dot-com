This course covers: first order equations, second order equations, Laplace transform method, numerical solution of initial value problems, boundary-value problems.

There are several problems to be solved for each week. The problems are given in "Work Sheets", and solutions "Answer Sheets".

### Errata

1. In wk06_ans.pdf, at the last line of problem 2, the denominator of the coefficient of $x^2$ should be $120$ (instead of $240$).

1. In wk07_ans.pdf, problem 3-b), the second $e$ in the final result should be instead $1$

1. In wk08_ans.pdf, problem 2-b), the $2$ in $x_1(t)$ should be deleted (check the program above to see the correct answer). Similarly, in 3-a), there is a missing bracket in $x_1(t)$.
