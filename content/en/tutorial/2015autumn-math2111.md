This course covers: systems of linear equations; vector spaces; linear transformations; matrix representation of linear transformations; linear operators, eigenvalues and eigenvectors; similarity invariants and canonical forms.

There are several problems to be solved for each week, except for the first week where we do some reviews on the preliminaries. The problems and solution are given in "Problems & Solutions". After the tutorial sessions, I will provide some more detailed explanations based on the outcome.
